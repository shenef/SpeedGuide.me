# Boktai 1 any%

## About this Guide
This Guide is intended for newer runners of the Japanese version of Boktai: The Sun is in your Hands.
It has been made by the [Taiyoh Network Community](https://discord.gg/0dUb9OmJrIrRPFGf).
Screenshots are only provided for hidden Chests.
At the end of this Guide is a Map of the Game with the Route drawn onto it.

#### Terminology:
- Safety Strategy: Mostly extra healing items or Speednuts and Enduranuts, feel free to skip those if you feel comfortable with the run and are not doing a marathon run or race
- Backup: Usually a safer, easier or alternative Strategy
- Lux: the unit of the ingame Sunlight meter 

## Beginning of the Run
Set Date and Time:
- On Console: 
  - 2003 年 07 月 17 日
  - 午前 04時 00分
- On Emulator: 
  - GBA > Settings > Sync Settings
  - "17/07/2003 04:00"
  - Set "RTC use Real Time" to "False"
  - Set "Skip BIOS" to "False"

With this time,
- you will get Ghouls during Fog Castle, sunlight will kill them immediately, and they will most likely drop healing items,
- better enemies in Firetop Mountain,
- you will reach Delusion Forest during the Day (enables you to skip the RNG Manipulation there)

Optional on Emulator: Increase the Light on the Start Screen (visualized by Sun animation speed)

- Create a new save file, 
- reduce the name to one character,
- keep the default region setting, 
- select your Difficulty (keep in mind that every Difficulty is a separate Category, this guide is made for the default setting, Normal 2),
- start the timer when confirming on the Summary Screen.

After the intro, pause the game and set the text speed to "Fast", it only saves about 3-4 seconds so you should be fast at that menu.

## Fog Castle
- have 1 Lux or more to kill the ghouls outside
- Coffin room: Defeat the bats and open the chest (5x speed nut, but you will keep 2 of them for Solar Tree)  
  Caution: The Chest won't spawn if you run out of energy against the bats.

## Sabata Fight
#### 1st phase:
- Go to the right-middle part (to the statue), knock on the wall (make sure you're in the up-left corner)
- Hide behind the statue, stunlock sabata with Crusader frame
- When Sabata starts spinning, continue spreading
- When he starts running away, go in the center and press aim to align yourself to where Sabata is, and use a grenade
  - Backup Strat: quickly go near him before the clones get too far and just shoot him to cancel the clones
- Repeat the first 2 steps

  - Use Speed Nuts to easier avoid the attraction of the Black Hole
  - in some spots you can avoid the attraction
- Stunlock him in the upper area
- Move on, don't forget the hidden items in the last rooms before Hel

## Hel
#### 1st Phase:
- Use Crusader frame, focus on Otenko
- Use rising sun grenades if you have any, preferrably shortly after otenko has been knocked down by Hel 
- Depending on your position, you won't always be able to spread on Otenko, so it's a good time to charge energy instead 

#### 2nd Phase:
- Take care of hands with Crusader frame
- help Sabata if he gets grabbed (otherwise it can cause an extra cycle)
- When she attacks with her hands, it's a good time to get some energy from sunlight
- Use speed nuts (easier to dodge, rescue Sabata, etc)

## GG you've finished a run!
- Time to order dominos :^)
- Also don't forget to let the credits roll and show the playthrough ranking screen (needed for in-game time, Also, thats where JRTA timing stops, though we don't use that)
