# any% Offline Very Easy Route
These Notes have been created from findings and routing by the Death Stranding Speedrunning Community.  
- [Speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/deathstranding)  
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/xFwgwdx)

### Rules
> All runs must start from the main menu or difficulty select screen. Runs must be Single Segment. Time starts after OK when you input your birthday and ends on the credits screen “Written and Directed by Hideo Kojima” Submit both Real Time & In-Game Time. RTA Timer must be shown on screen, and results screen must be included in the video.  
>
> Starting from “New Game”, complete the game as fast as possible. You may NOT change the difficulty at any point during a run. Continuing from an Auto-Save, or Loading Manual Saves, is allowed.  
>
> All runs require game audio. If your run has portions muted due to copyright music, your run will be rejected. (In-Game tracks by Low Roar and Silent Poets are the exceptions to this rule.) Separate music also must not overpower the game audio. Local recording is suggested to avoid this.  
>
> Missing footage could result in the run being rejected. If the video provided is a past broadcast from Twitch, please use the Highlight feature to include only the run. Again, local recordings are suggested.  
>
> Run must be done in offline mode.  
>
> The use of SSD is allowed.  

### Terminology
- CS = Cutscene Skip (Press start, left, X)
- DS = Dialogue Skip (mash X)
- PCC1 = PCC Level 1, Shoes1 = Shoes Level 1, ...
- Complete Delivery and Connect Chiral Network = usually a few cutscene skips and a dialogue skip
- Auto-Arrange = Press Triangle to optimize Cargo position
- Drop everything = Hold Triangle to quickly drop all carried cargo

## General Tips
- Stumbling is faster than walking (especially down hills), press X while off balance to manually trip yourself
- Hold L2+R2 to avoid falls when dropping down
- Movement is faster with less weight, ideally you'd have no cargo
- In a whiteout, use the terrain scanner and compass for easy navigation
- Autoskip is faster
